MashTempCalc

Yet another brewing script.

As with each of my previous scripts there is no error handling. This is something I am planning to add in
the future but for now they are functional with out. This script simply calculates the temp for you're
strike water on you're initial mash. It will also calculate how much *boiling water to add to your mash
to raise the temperature to your specified rest temps.

* Boiling as defined by How to Brew is calculated at 210*F to compensate for any loss in temperature
during the transfer period from the hot liquor tank to the mash tun.

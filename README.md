MashTempCalc

Yet another brewing script.

As with each of my previous scripts there is no error handling. This is something I am planning to add in
the future but for now they are functional with out. This script simply calculates the temp for you're
strike water on you're initial mash. It will also calculate how much 'boiling' water to add to your mash
to raise the temperature to your specified rest temps.

'Boiling' as defined by How to Brew is calculated at 210*F to compensate for any loss in temperature
during the transfer period from the hot liquor tank to the mash tun.
Also note ,as with the How to Brew formulas this script is based on, the script does not take into account
loss of temperature through the mash tun. Both the formula and the script assume that the mash tun has been
pre-heated with hot water to minimalize the temperature loss between the strike water and the mash tun walls.
